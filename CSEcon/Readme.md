## QUESTION 1
### When computer science meets economics: Who do you truly want to become?
Pick one of your favorite Nobel Prize winners ([Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/)) and Turing Award winners ([Turing Award](https://amturing.acm.org/)). How do you want to contribute to the intersection of the two north stars to advance human civilizations?

I aim to be a trailblazer in conducting original and inventive research that stretches the boundaries of knowledge, focusing on economic and computational strategies to improve financial wisdom among people. My favorite Nobel Prize recipient, Richard Thaler, has deeply influenced my thoughts on personal habit formation and societal economic impacts through his research on nudging. Similarly, Turing Award winner Geoffery Hinton's pioneering work in artificial intelligence and neural networks demonstrates the profound capabilities and ethical considerations necessary in technological advancements. Inspired by these leaders, I am dedicated to merging economics, social theory, and computer science to foster a society where technology and economic strategies empower rather than inhibit, promoting global positive development.

## QUESTION 2
### CS&Econ for a Better Future: How do you perceive the synergy between computer science and economics as a catalyst for steering innovation toward a brighter future?
Please present a foundational assertion, followed by multiple specific instances that support your claim, including a reference to a topic discussed at the colloquium on Friday, March 22.

The integration of computer science and economics is critical to societal progression. The evolution of AI, rooted in economic theories like game theory, exemplifies this synergy. For instance, advancements in AI have significantly benefited from game theory's ability to model human decision-making processes, as highlighted during the panel discussion with Greg Sun from Microsoft. Sun discussed how technological innovations, particularly in deep learning, have both macro and microeconomic impacts, enhancing understanding of consumer behavior and driving business success. This blend of computational power and economic insight underpins the joint evolution of these fields, tracing back to foundational work by figures like John von Neumann.

## QUESTION 3
### Beyond CS & Econ: How are aspects of human nature, like bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies, such as generative AI, reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts?
Additionally, how might this interplay be perceived and conceptualized distinctively from current models? Address this inquiry by drawing upon the literature covered in our lectures and supplementary scholarly works, ensuring to include in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography.

Game theory's application in AI research is instrumental for advancing technologies that address complex strategic scenarios involving multiple agents. This research, exploring multiagent learning and the integration of economic game theory, tests and challenges the assumptions underlying both computational and economic models. Notable discrepancies, such as those between theoretical Nash equilibriums and their computational reflections in multi-agent systems, suggest an ongoing need to refine and reconcile these frameworks to better understand and harness AI's capabilities in economic and strategic contexts.
