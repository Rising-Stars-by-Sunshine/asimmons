# About Me

## My Vision

I am driven to conduct original and inventive research that pushes the boundaries of knowledge, particularly in developing economic and computational strategies to help people manage their finances more wisely. I draw inspiration from pioneers like Nobel Prize recipient Richard Thaler and Turing Award winner Geoffery Hinton, who have made significant impacts in their respective fields.

### Richard Thaler

Thaler's research on the social and economic impacts of nudging has reshaped my approach to daily routines and self-improvement. For instance, I nudge myself towards better habits by placing my gym shoes by my desk or automating savings deposits.

### Geoffery Hinton

Hinton's groundbreaking work in AI and neural networks has not only advanced technology but also brought attention to its social impacts. His ethical considerations inspire my goal to blend computer science with economic and social theories to create supportive and sustainable societal systems.

## Research Interests

### Intersection of Computer Science and Economics

The synergy between computer science and economics is crucial for societal advancement. Innovations in AI, heavily reliant on economic theories like game theory, showcase the potential of this interdisciplinary approach. Historical developments under leaders like John von Neumann and contemporary insights from professionals like Greg Sun highlight the ongoing relevance of this fusion in technology and business.

### Game Theory and AI

The application of game theory in AI is essential for developing technologies that can simulate and optimize human decision-making. My research aims to explore these interactions further, testing and refining the theoretical foundations that support modern computational models.
