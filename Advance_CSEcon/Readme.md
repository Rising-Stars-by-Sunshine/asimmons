## QUESTION 1
### Analyze your experience with oTree, identifying pain points in behavioral game theory research. Review related literature and class discussions to understand experimental economics' goals. Propose a software solution that outperforms oTree in at least three aspects, enhancing strategic interaction studies.

Reflecting on my journey with oTree, a linchpin in the realms of experimental economics and behavioral game theory, I've stumbled upon significant challenges, primarily due to its cumbersome compatibility with Windows systems. My ambition to craft flexible models for various economic and social quandaries was often thwarted by this mismatch, despite the inspiration I drew from exploring cybersecurity through economic viewpoints as hinted by Chen (2020). The dream of seamlessly deploying models to test economic theories or simulate cybersecurity situations was constantly impeded by the software's stubborn incompatibility and the arduous task of locating the oTree file path on my machine.

This friction with Windows systems is particularly disheartening, given its ubiquity in academic and professional settings. Such incompatibility restricts access to oTree's full capabilities, dimming the lights on the potential for diverse and profound research in experimental economics. The struggle to locate necessary file paths adds to these operational challenges, introducing delays and frustrations that contradict the spirit of efficient research.

A solution that outpaces oTree would ideally excel in compatibility across operating systems, ease of installation and setup, and user interface intuitiveness:
1. **Operating System Compatibility**: Bridging the software across various operating systems, including Windows, could open wider opportunities for researchers, enriching the field with more inclusive and applicable insights.
2. **Streamlined Setup Process**: Simplifying the setup process could transform the user experience, offering a clear path forward that frees researchers to focus more on the essence of their experiments rather than untangling installation issues.
3. **Intuitive User Interface**: An intuitive interface that guides users through experiment design and deployment could democratize experimental economics research further, lowering the software's learning curve and unleashing its full potential.

These enhancements are not merely technical fixes; they represent opportunities to expand new horizons for experimental economics, deepening our understanding of complex economic behaviors and systems. Addressing the current limitations with oTree, particularly around software compatibility and ease of use, could foster a more streamlined and inclusive research process. This development is crucial not only for the academic community but also has broader implications for policy-making and economic strategies, potentially leading to more enlightened and effective decisions.

## QUESTION 2
### Delve into the limitations of current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks, focusing on environment constraints and agent algorithm customizations. Choose a classic game (e.g., Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, or the Trust Game) to illustrate these limitations. Describe the development process of a MARL agent for your selected game, detailing the definition of states, actions, and rewards grounded in fundamental behavioral assumptions.

Diving into the world of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially through strategic games like the Trust Game, exposes a mix of dazzling possibilities and glaring shortcomings. These MARL frameworks, designed to mimic the complex decision-making dynamics among autonomous entities, highlight the vast potential for dissecting strategy intricacies. Yet, the practical application of MARL often encounters significant obstacles, from the rigid confines of simulated environments to the challenges of customizing algorithms and the extensive trial and error required to develop effective strategies.

For instance, in the Trust Game, the delicate balance of cooperation and trust must be intricately modeled. States might include various factors such as each player's holdings, past moves, and perceived trustworthiness. Actions could involve decisions on monetary transfers, while rewards relate to both immediate payoffs and long-term relationship outcomes. However, the sophistication required to capture these nuanced decisions and subtleties often surpasses the capabilities of our current MARL toolset.

**Personal Experience Example**: My attempts to model the Trust Game using a MARL framework revealed profound limitations. Despite the promise of these frameworks to evolve gameplay logic autonomously, progress was frustratingly slow, illustrating the need for significant advancements in MARL technology.

**Potential Improvements**:
- **Pre-trained Models**: Introducing pre-trained models that start with a baseline understanding of strategic dos and don'ts could reduce the number of necessary trial runs.
- **Advanced Learning Techniques**: Integrating machine learning techniques that better mimic human thought processes could enhance the realism and relevance of MARL simulations, potentially revolutionizing how we simulate complex strategic interactions.

## QUESTION 3
### Critically engage with existing research in the field of federated learning, using the specific paper presented by the guest speaker as a primary example. Students will assess the paper's research questions, methodologies, and application scenarios and propose new research ideas addressing the identified limitations or gaps.

Building upon the insights provided by Professor Bing Luo's paper on "Cost-Effective Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Networks," there is a noteworthy attempt to delineate an optimized incentive structure that motivates client participation in federated learning, alongside managing economic constraints effectively. This research focuses on enhancing the efficiency and participation rates in federated learning models within mobile edge networksâ€”a crucial area considering the growing demands for edge computing and data privacy concerns in today's digital era.

**Research Questions**: The paper seeks to determine how federated learning models can be both cost-effective and appealing enough to encourage broad participation, a significant challenge given the complexity of training machine learning models across numerous devices with data localization.

**Methodologies**: The study employs a combination of algorithmic designs and economic models to simulate and analyze the interaction between cost constraints and participation incentives, providing a nuanced understanding of the dynamics governing federated learning networks.

**Application Scenarios**: The relevance of mobile edge computing environments where federated learning enhances privacy and efficiency is particularly significant given the surge in smart device usage and data generation at the network's edge.

**Proposed New Research Ideas**:
- **Data Diversity and Quality**: Addressing the potential for data skewness and overrepresentation by exploring alternative incentives that prioritize data diversity and robustness.
- **Advanced Technologies**: Incorporating technologies like blockchain for immutable model updates and generative AI for balancing datasets could address the challenges of trust, transparency, and data bias.

These approaches not only aim to optimize federated learning networks but also enrich the research by expanding beyond traditional computer science and economics frameworks, potentially paving the way for more adaptive, secure, and inclusive federated learning ecosystems.
