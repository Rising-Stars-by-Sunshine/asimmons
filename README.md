Repository for my work in Computational Microeconomics

Hello! I'm a junior at Duke University, currently studying at Duke Kunshan University (DKU). My academic journey has ignited a deep-seated fascination with technology, particularly in the realms of blockchain and cybersecurity. These fields, both dynamic and critical in the digital age, captivate me with their complexity and the promise they hold for shaping the future of our digital world.

My interest in blockchain stems from its revolutionary potential to redefine transactions, enhance security, and foster trust in a decentralized manner. The implications for industries such as finance, supply chain, and beyond, are profoundly transformative. I'm keen on exploring how blockchain technology can further secure digital identities, assets, and transactions against cyber threats.

Cybersecurity, on the other hand, presents a challenging battlefield in the protection of data integrity and privacy. As digital threats evolve, so does my curiosity to understand and combat them. I'm particularly interested in the strategies and technologies that can be employed to protect against cyberattacks, ensuring the safety of digital information.

As I navigate through my junior year, my goal is to delve deeper into these subjects, seeking opportunities to engage in projects, internships, and collaborative research. I am eager to connect with professionals and peers who share these interests, hoping to exchange ideas and contribute to advancements in these fields.
