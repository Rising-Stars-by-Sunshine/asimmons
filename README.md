Repository for my work in Computational Microeconomics

Hello! I'm a junior at Duke University, currently studying at Duke Kunshan University (DKU). My academic journey has ignited a deep-seated fascination with technology, particularly in the realms of blockchain and cybersecurity. These fields, both dynamic and critical in the digital age, captivate me with their complexity and the promise they hold for shaping the future of our digital world.

My interest in blockchain stems from its revolutionary potential to redefine transactions, enhance security, and foster trust in a decentralized manner. The implications for industries such as finance, supply chain, and beyond, are profoundly transformative. I'm keen on exploring how blockchain technology can further secure digital identities, assets, and transactions against cyber threats.

Cybersecurity, on the other hand, presents a challenging battlefield in the protection of data integrity and privacy. As digital threats evolve, so does my curiosity to understand and combat them. I'm particularly interested in the strategies and technologies that can be employed to protect against cyberattacks, ensuring the safety of digital information.

As I navigate through my junior year, my goal is to delve deeper into these subjects, seeking opportunities to engage in projects, internships, and collaborative research. I am eager to connect with professionals and peers who share these interests, hoping to exchange ideas and contribute to advancements in these fields.

Reflection:

Intellectual Growth:
The course catalyzed intellectual growth by showcasing the potency of machine learning in tackling social and economic challenges. It illuminated the 'magic' of interdisciplinary research: the synergy that arises when diverse fields converge, particularly when economic models meet computational prowess, yielding holistic solutions to complex problems like cybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns.

Professional Growth:
Professionally, the course has been a crucible for forging a skill set at the nexus of economics and computer science. Delving into cybersecurity's economic aspects and data privacy's valuation has cultivated a versatile profile, adept at navigating the evolving terrain where technology intersects with human-centric policies.

Living a Purposeful Life:
In contemplating a monumental achievement like a Nobel Prize or Turing Award, the aspiration would be to pioneer equitable data privacy systems that recognize individual data ownership and fair compensation, thus harmonizing personal rights with economic innovation. The contribution sought is a balanced digital economy that secures personal data while fostering collective advancement.
