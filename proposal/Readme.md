Proposal Description for Mechanism Design to Enhance Cybersecurity Collaboration
Title: Enhancing Cybersecurity Collaboration through Game Theoretical Models and Blockchain Technology

Introduction:
Cybersecurity threats are increasingly sophisticated, necessitating unprecedented levels of data sharing and collaboration among companies. This proposal introduces a novel mechanism design that leverages game theory, specifically the Stag Hunt model, along with blockchain technology and smart contracts, to facilitate and secure inter-company cybersecurity cooperation.

Objective:
The primary objective of this mechanism is to increase cybersecurity collaboration among companies across various industries by providing incentives for sharing threat intelligence and sensitive information. This system aims to enhance collective cybersecurity efforts, thereby reducing the overall vulnerability of each participant to cyber threats.

Theoretical Foundation - The Stag and Hare Model:
The Stag Hunt game provides a strategic framework for understanding cooperation. In this context, hunting a stag represents companies collaborating to share comprehensive threat data, which yields higher collective benefits but requires mutual trust and cooperation. Conversely, hunting a hare represents companies working individually, yielding lower but guaranteed outcomes. This model predicts that when trust and assurance mechanisms are in place, companies are more likely to engage in cooperative "stag" strategies, as the potential payoffs from collaboration exceed those of independent actions.

Blockchain and Smart Contracts:
Blockchain technology will serve as the backbone of this mechanism by providing a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for sharing information. Blockchain's immutable ledger will ensure that data once entered cannot be altered, fostering trust among participants. Smart contracts will automate the execution of agreements based on predefined rules. For example, when a company shares verified threat intelligence, the smart contract will automatically execute incentives or rewards, ensuring compliance and prompt reciprocation.

Incentive Structures:
Incentives will be strategically designed to encourage sharing based on the importance and sensitivity of the information:

Tiered Access: Companies providing high-value information gain access to more comprehensive data from the pool, encouraging the sharing of more significant intelligence.
Reputation Scoring: Participants will receive scores based on their contribution levels and reliability, enhancing their industry standing and providing indirect marketing benefits.
Financial Incentives: Participants could be offered reduced cybersecurity insurance premiums, tax breaks, or other financial incentives aligned with the level and sensitivity of the information shared.
Predicted Value of the Model:
The proposed model is expected to significantly reduce the incidence and impact of cyber attacks on participating companies by improving the detection and mitigation of threats through collective intelligence. By fostering an environment of trust and cooperation, companies can more effectively pool resources against common threats, leading to cost savings and enhanced security postures. Furthermore, the transparency and efficiency introduced by blockchain and smart contracts are predicted to streamline operations and reduce the overhead associated with traditional information-sharing methods.

Implementation Phases:

Pilot Program: Implement the mechanism with a select group of companies to refine the system and gather initial data.
Evaluation and Scaling: Analyze the effectiveness of the pilot, make necessary adjustments, and gradually expand to include more participants across various sectors.
Continuous Improvement: Regularly update the mechanism based on feedback and evolving cybersecurity landscapes to ensure it remains effective and relevant.
