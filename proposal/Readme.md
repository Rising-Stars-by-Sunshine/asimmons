[Summarize the Background/Motivation]

Gaps in Existing Literature: Current literature falls short in addressing the interplay between human and AI agents within the digital economy's complex system, particularly how economic incentives and privacy concerns influence data sharing in cybersecurity. My research is inspired by this gap, recognizing the necessity to understand and facilitate cooperation in an ecosystem where trust is pivotal yet precarious.

[Research Questions]

Intended Questions: My research aims to answer how mechanism design can incentivize inter-company data sharing for enhanced cybersecurity and how the ownership and value of data can be equitably managed within digital economies.
Importance of the Questions: These questions address the foundational issues of trust and cooperation in the digital age, crucial for robust cybersecurity practices and fair data economies.
Unanswered by Existing Literature: Existing game theory research has not fully reconciled the complex incentives and multi-agent interactions that characterize modern cybersecurity challenges, nor has it accounted for the unique attributes of data as an asset in the digital economy.

[Application Scenario]

Real-world Application: The proposed mechanisms are directly applicable to Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) where companies must share threat intelligence to bolster collective security.
Behavioral Foundation Literature: Insights from psychology, especially those concerning trust and reciprocity from behavioral game theory, provide a behavioral underpinning for the proposed game models and mechanisms.

[Methodology]

Game Theoretical/Framework: The Stag Hunt and Trust Game serve as foundational models, augmented to address multi-agent systems and information asymmetries characteristic of cybersecurity collaborations.
Computational/Analytical Tools: Advanced machine learning algorithms and cryptographic methods, including blockchain and smart contract technology, are applied to model and secure data transactions.
Interdisciplinary Integration: The methodology integrates economic theory with computational trust models and privacy-preserving technologies to address the challenges identified.

[Preliminary Results]

Illustration Example: By utilizing our mechanism, a simulated ISAC demonstrates significantly improved threat detection rates and reduced incident response times, directly impacting the welfare objective of societal safety.

[Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts]

Limitations Inspiring Future Research: While current research advances cybersecurity cooperation, it has yet to explore the full spectrum of human welfare objectives, such as fairness and equity in data value distribution, which opens avenues for future work.
Application to Decision Making: This research has practical applications for individual, corporate, and governmental decision-making by providing a framework that informs strategic decisions in sharing sensitive information and aligning disparate incentives in both cybersecurity and social choice contexts.
